Technical Specification for the Development and Optimization of the Telegram Bot

This project requires the development and optimization of a Telegram bot for the Republic of Uzbekistan. The bot must be written exclusively in Python, without creating unnecessary additional files, and it must operate with high reliability, scalability, and zero errors. The following requirements must be implemented:

User Registration with Regional Data

The registration process must include the complete list of all regions, cities, districts, and neighborhoods of Uzbekistan.

Users must be able to select these options through interactive buttons.

Each section must also provide a manual input option, in case a specific location is not listed.

Admin Panel Optimization

The admin panel must provide full functionality of a super admin panel without any delays or errors.

All features, including statistics, user lists, and other management tools, must work 100% correctly.

Data Export

All exportable data must be available in Excel and PDF formats.

Export functionality must handle large datasets without cutting off or misformatting long names or large entries.

Test Management and Execution

The bot must support seamless test creation and execution without any technical errors.

During tests, users must not be logged out of the bot under any circumstances.

No AI or automated tools may interfere with the test-solving process to ensure security and authenticity.

Scalability and Performance

The bot must be capable of serving 10,000+ users simultaneously.

The system must be optimized to avoid freezing, delays, or performance issues.

Test Import Formats

The test management system must support uploading and importing tests in four different formats:

Word (.doc/.docx)

Excel (.xls/.xlsx)

PDF

Plain Text (.txt)

All formats must be processed 100% error-free.

Reliability and Importance

The bot must be delivered without any shortcomings.

Since this project is designed for the Republic of Uzbekistan, it is considered highly important and must be developed with maximum precision and reliability.
